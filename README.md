## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Variables

### What I learned

Working with images can be tricky. It can be tempting to throw
a background image on a div and move on. But using true images
is important for accessability. It always good to practice using
images in different projects and ensuring they adapt correctly
to different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

This article from CSS Tricks was helpful in identifying the
"object-position" property. [](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-position/)
